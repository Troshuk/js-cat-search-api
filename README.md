Start files[​](#start-files "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------

[Download the start file index.html](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/goitacademy/javascript-homework/tree/main/v2/10/src) with the basic markup of the task. Copy it to your project in the folder `src` in [parcel-project-template](https://github.com/goitacademy/parcel-project-template).

Assignment - Cat Search[​](#assignment---cat-search "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the frontend part of an application for searching information about a cat by its breed. Watch a demo video of the app, use it as a reference for the required functionality.

### HTTP-requests[​](#http-requests "Direct link to heading")

Use the public [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). To get started, you need to register and get a unique access key, which must be attached to each request. Go to [the main page](https://thecatapi.com/) and click the button `Signup for free` below. Follow the instructions. The key will be sent to the specified email.

The key must be used in the HTTP header `x-api-key`. It is recommended to use axios and add the header for all requests.

    import axios from "axios";axios.defaults.headers.common["x-api-key"] = "your key";

### The Breed Collection[​](#the-breed-collection "Direct link to heading")

When the page loads, an HTTP request for a collection of breeds must be performed. To do this, you need to make a GET request to the resource `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds` that returns an array of objects. If the request is successful, you must complete the `select.breed-select` with options so that the `value` of the option contains the `id` of the breed, and the user interface displays the name of the breed.

Write a function `fetchBreeds()` which makes an HTTP request and returns a promis with an array of breeds - the result of the request. Put it into the `cat-api.js` file and make named export.

### Information about a cat[​](#information-about-a-cat "Direct link to heading")

When the user chooses an option in the selector, it is necessary to query for complete information about the cat on the resource `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search`. Don't forget to specify the query string parameter `breed_ids` with the breed identifier.

This is what the request URL for full information about the dog by breed ID will look like.

    https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?breed_ids=breed_identifier

Write a function `fetchCatByBreed(breedId)` which expects breed ID, performs an HTTP request, and returns a promise with cat data - the request result. Put it into the `cat-api.js` file and make named export.

If the request was successful, under the selector an image and detailed information about the cat (breed name, description and temperament) appears in the `div.cat-info` block.

### Load status processing[​](#load-status-processing "Direct link to heading")

As long as there is any HTTP request, you must show the loader - element `p.loader`. As long as there are no requests, or when the request has finished, the loader must be hidden. Use additional CSS classes for this.

*   While the request for a list of breeds is going on, it is necessary to hide `select.breed-select` and show `p.loader`.
*   While the request for an information about cats is going on, it is necessary to hide `div.cat-info` and show `p.loader`.
*   After finishing any request, the `p.loader` should be hiden.

### Processing an error[​](#processing-an-error "Direct link to heading")

If a user had an error in any HTTP request, such as a network crash, packet loss, etc., which means that the promise was rejected, you should display the `p.error`element and hide it at each subsequent request. Use additional CSS classes for this

It is very easy to test if the error is displayed correctly - change the request address by adding any character to the end, for example, instead of `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds` try `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds123`. A request for a breed list will be rejected with an error. Similarly for requesting information about a cat by breed.

### The interface[​](#the-interface "Direct link to heading")

*   Add minimal design to the interface elements.
*   You can use any library with beautiful select instead of `select.breed-select`. For example, [https://slimselectjs.com/](https://slimselectjs.com/)
*   You can use any library with beautiful CSS-loaders instead of `p.loader`. For example, [https://cssloaders.github.io/](https://cssloaders.github.io/)
*   You can use any library with beautiful notifications instead of `p.error` For example, [Notiflix](https://github.com/notiflix/Notiflix#readme)
